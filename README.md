# Login Project
**Login Project** is a full-stack web application that provides a secure and modern user authentication system. The **frontend** is built using **React and Tailwind CSS**, while the **backend** is powered by **Node.js and Express** for handling user data and authentication logic.

# Frontend (Client)
# Features
- **Login Page** – Users can enter valid credentials to access the dashboard
- **Form Validation** – Ensures proper input before submission
- **Responsive Design** – Works seamlessly across all screen sizes
- **Modern UI** – Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, consistent look
- **API Integration** – Communicates with backend for authentication

# Technologies Used
- **React** – for dynamic component-based UI
- **Tailwind CSS** – for responsive and elegant styling
- **Axios / Fetch API** – for connecting to the backend

# Backend (Server)
# Features
- **User Authentication** – Validates login credentials
- **Secure Data Handling** – Uses Node.js and Express to manage requests
- **CORS Enabled** – Allows frontend-backend communication
- **Environment Configuration** – API keys and DB connections stored securely

# Technologies Used
- **Node.js** – for server-side scripting
- **Express.js** – for API routing and middleware handling
- **CORS** – for enabling cross-origin access
- **dotenv** – for environment variable management

# How It Works
- User enters their username and password on the frontend
- Data is sent via an API call to the backend
- Backend validates the credentials
- If valid, user is logged in and redirected to the home/dashboard page
